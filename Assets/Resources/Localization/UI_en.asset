    m_Localized: "You are Kali, a master pilot from the planet of Hanakiita. Hanakiita\u2019s
      ever-growing population has caused a severe lack of fuel resources. Kali has
      been sent out in search of more. \n\nThis leads him to Oleum 73, a planet full
      of these materials. On his way there, he collides with one of Oleum 73's own
      satellites, sending him and his spaceship racing down towards the planet\u2019s
      surface. \n\nHe safely lands, though his ship has been damaged in the process,
      causing parts of it to spread all over the crash site. The crash site happens
      to be inside of a building that contains a seemingly infinite amount of the
      planet\u2019s fuel resources, namely sugar and oil. \n\nKali must now search
      the bakery for the ship\u2019s missing parts in order to return home with the
      good news. "
