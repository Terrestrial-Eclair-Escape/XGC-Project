# Alien Bakery

In "Alien Bakery," embark on a mouth-watering adventure as a stranded alien in a whimsical 3D platformer. With your spaceship in disarray, navigate through the treacherous depths of a bakery at night, gathering the essential components needed to restore your interstellar craft. Keep your reflexes sharp as you encounter mischievous sugar-infused adversaries. Avoid getting flattened by iced rolling donuts and outsmart the wobbly antics of the bouncy jellies.  Do not get impaled by the gingerbread men armed with sugarcane poles mounted on speedy rats. Harness the power of physics-based interactions to skillfully grab and hurl peanuts, toothpicks, and sugar cubes at your foes. Repair your ship, outmaneuver the sugary nightmare, and escape the bakery's clutches before the sun rises.
